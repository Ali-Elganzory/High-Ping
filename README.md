Remove redundant information in the domain of online learning to reduce bandwidth needed to stream videos smoothly.

#### Instructions
To run the code you need to download the [model weights](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1A63-SeM1nZeB8d5VfW1cN3j0VSSIj01o) and put them in the Client folder. In the file Client/app.py are all the variables that you might want to change such as using a camera or a local file, and an option to render both a colored and a binarized image.
